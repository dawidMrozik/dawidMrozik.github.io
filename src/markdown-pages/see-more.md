I have a much more projects on my Github. Lots of them are my tryouts of some technologies i wanted to learn about. You can find there a recipe app built with Angular, game built with physics engine matter.js or even local streams app with simple RTMP server. Besides that i have some experience with Python, basics of Machine Leraning, Java,
C++, Go and even assembler.
