My biggest project so far - application built for my engineer thesis. It allows preparing binocular exercises with self defined matrixes and managing patients.
Users, matrixes, patients and their results belongs to institution. Users can create their own institutions and invite to them others for sharing previous mentioned data.
Application has built in color picker tool to adjust point colors for special red-green glasses which are required for this kind of exercises.
It's purpose was to help reduce costs in school for visually impaired.

Fullstack with PHP and React. Authentication with JWT, styled with Material Design and CSS-in-JS, state managment with Redux, atomic design as a project structure.
